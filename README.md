# Hello, world

I've decided to make all my self-made (hand-written) notes "open-source". 

Idk how useful they will be to others though.

Notes are taken on an iPad Air 3 (Apple Pencil) and using GoodNotes 5.

I only got the iPad a few weeks back so I've only officially started making notes from this sem onwards (Y2S1).
